This is a simple PacMan game implemented in HTML and JavaScript.

##Instructions

1. Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser.
2. Click on the "Add PacMan" button to add a PacMan character to the game area.
3. Once PacMan(s) are added, click on the "Start Game" button to start the game.
4. PacMan(s) will move randomly within the game area, bouncing off the edges.

##How to Use

1. Clicking the "Add PacMan" button adds a PacMan character to the game area.
2. Clicking the "Start Game" button starts the game, causing PacMan(s) to move.
3. PacMan(s) bounce off the edges of the game area.

##Code Structure

1. The HTML code defines the structure of the game interface and includes buttons for adding PacMan characters and starting the game.
2. The JavaScript code defines the game logic.
 * makePac() function creates a PacMan character and adds it to the game area.
 * update() function updates the position of each PacMan character and handles collision detection.
 * checkCollisions() function checks if PacMan characters collide with the edges of the game area.
 * Other helper functions and variables are also defined to support the game logic.
